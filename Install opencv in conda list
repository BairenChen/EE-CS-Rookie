I have installed and implemented Anaconda3 and PyCharm2019 in my PC. The environment configuration of PyCharm is based on the conda list in Anaconda3. 
In order to learn image process, I WANT TO INSTALL OPENCV IN CONDA LIST BUT FAILED.
Using
conda install -chttps://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
conda install -c menpo opencv
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken opencv
don't work.
====================step1====================
According to [https://blog.csdn.net/iracer/article/details/90746292], 
I downloaded the .whl file (opencv_python-4.2.0.34-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl) from [https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/opencv-python/].
(Here's an another address of downloading opencv but the speed is too slow, https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/opencv-python/)
I put the .whl file into Anaconda3 third-party package directory, ...\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages. (My path: D:\Applications\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages)
====================step2====================
Run cmd, and input cd /d D:\Applications\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages
(Reference of cd to the specified directory:

Input pip install opencv_python-4.2.0.34-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
It worked!!!
====================step3====================
Check the environment configuration: 
(1) Run Anaconda Prompt, input conda list, press enter and check whether opencv-python is in conda list;
(2) Run Pycharm, File-Settings-Project-Project Intepreter, and search opencv-python package, normally the file should exist.
